I didn't have to any changes because I already fixed them in exercise 2.8.

----------------
docker-compose.yml:

Same as exercise 8

----------------
Front Dockerfile:

FROM node:16-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY package* ./

RUN npm install && npm install -g serve

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

CMD [ "serve", "-s", "-l", "5000", "build" ]

----------------
Back Dockerfile:

FROM golang:1.16-alpine

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .

RUN go build

CMD [ "./server" ]
